# Kobuchisawa English Learning Site

A simple learning site made with Bootstrap, Javascript, CSS and HTML

## Description

This app was made during the beginning of the Covid-19 lockdown when all the students were still at home. At the time our school wasn't using Microsoft Teams and our students didn't have access to face to face instruction. I made this site to cover some of the basics of English while they were stuck at home using their cellphones or whatever technology they had available.

I later abandoned creating the site after the textbook changed and the school began using alternative methods for teaching.

### Key Functionality:
- Flash cards
- Sounds and Letters
## Demo - check it out [*here*](https://classy-torrone-c6e618.netlify.app/index.html)

## My Design Process

The design is based upon the color scheme for the English textbooks used at the time. First graders use red, blue is for second graders, with green being third graders. The overall scheme of each section of the site changes to match that of the grade level. The font is a free font from google fonts that is easy to read. I wanted this website to feel as comfortable as possible for the students to use so that they could feel confident navigating the website.
